this is my custom build of x360MediaServe from sourceforge (http://sourceforge.net/projects/x360mediaserve/).

From the website:
A upnp media server designed for streaming music, videos, and more to the Xbox 360. It is capable of transcoding many non supported formats including AAC,Ogg and Flac as well as the formats the 360 already supports (MP3 and WMA). Also capable of reading iTunes XML playlists.
